# Street Fighter Physics System Test Report

## Executive Summary
Comprehensive testing of the Street Fighter game's physics and collision systems has been completed. All core physics mechanics are functioning correctly with no critical bugs detected.

## Test Coverage

### 1. Gravity and Movement Physics ✅
- **Gravity Application**: Correctly applies 0.8 units/frame to airborne characters
- **Jump Mechanics**: Jump speed of -15 units creates proper parabolic arcs
- **Terminal Velocity**: No cap implemented (gravity accumulates infinitely)
- **Ground Detection**: Characters properly land at y=320 and stop falling

### 2. Collision Detection System ✅
- **Rectangle Overlap**: AABB collision detection working correctly
- **Directional Collisions**: Detects hits from all 4 directions
- **Corner Cases**: Properly handles corner overlaps
- **Edge Cases**: Zero-size and negative dimension rectangles handled safely

### 3. Screen Boundaries ✅
- **Left Edge**: Characters stop at x=0
- **Right Edge**: Characters stop at x=(800-width)
- **Ground Plane**: Fixed at y=320, prevents falling through
- **Ceiling**: No upper boundary (characters can jump off-screen)

### 4. Attack Hitboxes ✅
- **Punch Hitbox**: 30x80 units, extends from character edge
- **Kick Hitbox**: 40x80 units with vertical offset
- **Special Hitbox**: 50x80 units for special moves
- **Directional Attacks**: Hitboxes correctly positioned based on facing direction

### 5. Damage System ✅
- **Damage Values**: Punch=15, Kick=20, Special=25 HP
- **Invulnerability**: 30 frames after being hit
- **Blocking**: Prevents all damage when active
- **HP Clamping**: Health never goes below 0

## Issues Found

### Minor Issues
1. **No Terminal Velocity**: Gravity accumulates infinitely, which could cause issues with very long falls
2. **No Ceiling Boundary**: Characters can jump above the visible screen area
3. **Character Overlap**: Players can partially overlap each other (no push-apart physics)
4. **No Air Control Dampening**: Full movement speed available while airborne

### Potential Improvements
1. **Add Terminal Velocity**: Cap falling speed at reasonable maximum
2. **Implement Push Physics**: Prevent character overlap by pushing them apart
3. **Add Air Control**: Reduce movement speed while jumping
4. **Screen Shake**: Add visual feedback for heavy attacks
5. **Variable Gravity**: Different fall speeds for different moves

## Edge Cases Tested

### ✅ Passed
- High-speed collisions at screen edges
- Simultaneous horizontal and vertical movement
- Rapid direction changes
- Attack hitboxes at screen boundaries
- Multiple simultaneous collisions
- Floating point precision handling

### ⚠️ Potential Issues
- Extremely high velocities (>100 units/frame) might clip through boundaries
- Character spawning inside each other has no resolution
- No handling for framerates other than 60 FPS

## Performance Analysis

### Collision Detection
- Current O(n²) complexity for n characters
- Efficient for 2 characters (current game)
- Would need spatial partitioning for many characters

### Physics Calculations
- Lightweight calculations suitable for 60 FPS
- No performance issues detected
- Memory usage minimal

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Add Character Separation**: Implement push-apart physics when characters overlap
2. **Terminal Velocity**: Cap maximum falling speed at 20-25 units/frame
3. **Frame-Rate Independence**: Use delta time for physics calculations

### Medium Priority
1. **Air Control**: Reduce horizontal movement speed to 70% while airborne
2. **Variable Jump Height**: Allow short hops with quick button release
3. **Crouch Hitbox**: Reduce character height when crouching

### Low Priority
1. **Advanced Collisions**: Add slopes or curved surfaces
2. **Particle Effects**: Add dust clouds for landings
3. **Physics Debugging**: Add visual hitbox display mode

## Test Suite Usage

To run the comprehensive physics tests:
```bash
# Run basic tests
npm test

# For detailed physics tests (requires Jest)
jest __tests__/physics.test.js
```

## Conclusion

The Street Fighter game's physics system is robust and functional. All critical physics mechanics work correctly, providing a solid fighting game experience. The identified minor issues do not impact gameplay significantly but could be addressed in future updates for a more polished experience.
