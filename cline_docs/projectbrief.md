# Project Brief: Street Fighter Clone

## Core Requirements
- Build a simplified but functional fighting game inspired by Street Fighter
- Create a web-based implementation using Next.js, React, and Canvas
- Implement core fighting game mechanics (movement, attacks, blocking, special moves)
- Support keyboard-based controls for player input
- Create a complete game loop with five rounds of increasing difficulty
- Include proper health meters, timer, and win/lose conditions
- Design for easy customization with replaceable placeholder assets

## Project Goals
- Demonstrate game development techniques with modern web technologies
- Implement a performant game loop with physics, collision detection, and input handling
- Create a responsive design that scales to fill the browser window
- Build a simple AI opponent with varying difficulty levels
- Optimize for static export and simple deployment
- Make the project accessible for educational purposes

## Target Experience
- Five rounds against an NPC with increasing difficulty
- 60-second rounds with health bars and timer
- Win by depleting NPC health or having more health when time expires
- Player health partially restores between rounds (20% up to 100%)
- Special move combinations for advanced techniques
- Win/lose screen after final round
- Responsive canvas that scales to fill the browser

## Technical Requirements
- Built with Next.js for static site generation
- Uses React for component architecture
- Implements HTML5 Canvas API for game rendering
- Styled with Tailwind CSS
- Optimized for deployment on Netlify
- Supports keyboard controls with special move detection
- Includes placeholder assets that can be replaced
