# Project Progress: Street Fighter Clone

## What Works
- Project structure is established with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS
- Game canvas with responsive scaling to fit the browser window
- Core game mechanics implemented:
  - Player movement (left/right, jump, crouch)
  - Attack system (light/heavy punches and kicks)
  - Special move detection with input buffering
  - Health system with blocking damage reduction
  - Round system with increasing AI difficulty
  - Timer with round end conditions
  - Win/lose detection and game over screen
- NPC AI with idle, approach, attack, and defend states
- Sprite and audio assets (placeholders) are available
- Physics system with gravity and collision detection
- Package.json file structure is fixed
- Dependencies configured correctly for Next.js 9.1.1
- NODE_OPTIONS added to scripts for OpenSSL legacy provider support
- CSS configuration updated with @zeit/next-css
- Tailwind CSS dependencies adjusted for compatibility
- Added styled-components for server-side rendering in _document.js
- Memory Bank documentation completed with all required files

## What's Left to Build
- Test the build process and development server with the updated configuration
- Verify all game mechanics function as expected
- Optimize sprite loading and rendering performance
- Enhance NPC AI for more dynamic gameplay
- Add sound effect implementations
- Refine UI elements for better visual feedback
- Add more special moves and combos
- Ensure proper build configuration for Netlify deployment
