# Active Context: Street Fighter Clone

## What I'm Working On Now
- Created the projectbrief.md document to complete the Memory Bank structure
- Reviewing the GameEngine.js implementation
- Analyzing game mechanics and physics for possible improvements

## Recent Changes
- Created and completed all Memory Bank documentation files
- Fixed the package.json structure by adding the missing opening curly brace
- Resolved dependency conflicts by downgrading Next.js to 9.1.1 and React to 16.11.0
- Added NODE_OPTIONS='--openssl-legacy-provider' to npm scripts to resolve OpenSSL errors
- Removed problematic macOS resource fork files
- Updated dependency versions to be compatible with Next.js 9.1.1:
  - Tailwind CSS downgraded to 1.1.4
  - PostCSS downgraded to 7.0.21
  - Autoprefixer downgraded to 9.7.1
  - Added @zeit/next-css for CSS modules support
- Updated next.config.js to use @zeit/next-css for proper CSS handling
- Installed missing styled-components dependency required by _document.js

## Next Steps
1. Test the build process with the updated configuration
2. Verify that the development server runs correctly
3. Check that game mechanics function as expected
4. Refine NPC AI behavior for more dynamic gameplay
5. Optimize sprite loading and rendering performance
6. Ensure proper build configuration for Netlify deployment

## Current Focus
Completing the Memory Bank documentation by creating the projectbrief.md file. Analyzing the GameEngine.js implementation to understand the core game mechanics including the game loop, player controls, physics, sprite rendering, and NPC AI. Next focus will be testing the application to verify it runs correctly after the dependency and configuration fixes.
