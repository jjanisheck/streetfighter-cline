# Active Context: Street Fighter Clone

## What I'm Working On Now
- Added styled-components dependency for _document.js
- Configured Next.js 9.1.1 to work with Tailwind CSS
- Fixed package.json dependencies to use compatible versions

## Recent Changes
- Created the Memory Bank documentation files
- Fixed the package.json structure by adding the missing opening curly brace
- Resolved dependency conflicts by downgrading Next.js to 9.1.1 and React to 16.11.0
- Added NODE_OPTIONS='--openssl-legacy-provider' to npm scripts to resolve OpenSSL errors
- Removed problematic macOS resource fork files
- Updated dependency versions to be compatible with Next.js 9.1.1:
  - Tailwind CSS downgraded to 1.1.4
  - PostCSS downgraded to 7.0.21
  - Autoprefixer downgraded to 9.7.1
  - Added @zeit/next-css for CSS modules support
- Updated next.config.js to use @zeit/next-css for proper CSS handling
- Discovered and installed missing styled-components dependency required by _document.js

## Next Steps
1. Test the build process with the updated configuration
2. Verify that the development server can start
3. Check that Tailwind CSS styles are correctly applied
4. Ensure proper build configuration for Netlify deployment

## Current Focus
Resolving all missing dependencies to ensure a successful build. We discovered the project uses styled-components for server-side rendering styles in _document.js, which was added as a dependency. Now we're ready to test the build process again.
