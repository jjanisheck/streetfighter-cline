# Product Context: Street Fighter Clone

## Why This Project Exists
- To create a simplified but functional implementation of a classic fighting game
- To demonstrate game development principles using web technologies
- To provide a customizable foundation that can be extended with custom sprites and sounds

## Problems It Solves
- Provides an accessible implementation of game mechanics using modern web technologies
- Demonstrates how to build real-time interactive experiences in the browser
- Offers a complete game loop with player input, AI responses, and scoring

## How It Should Work
- Players control a character using keyboard inputs to fight against an NPC opponent
- Game consists of five rounds with increasing difficulty
- Each round lasts 60 seconds with health bars and timer
- Player wins by depleting the NPC's health or having more health when time expires
- Player's health partially restores between rounds (20% up to 100%)
- Game includes special move combinations for advanced techniques
- After round five, the game shows a win/lose screen
